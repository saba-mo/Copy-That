# Copy That

Do you have an image with text that you wish you could search or copy from? Copy That can help. Just upload your file and Copy That will use optical character recognition to covert it to a searchable and copyable PDF. You will also see the extracted text on the Copies page so you can search all your copies in one place.

Copy That was made during a 3-day solo hackathon. It currently supports images that include text in English, Spanish or Persian.
